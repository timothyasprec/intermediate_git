# Amend a Commit

Usecase: After working on a new component, I have 13 commits that I have made at many intermediate steps. These steps seems to be more than are necessary to represent sensible milestones for this work. I want to drop some of the commits without changing and of the code. How can I do this? 



# Squash Unnecessary Commits 

checkout a new branch
Make three commits, adding something to the same feature each time 
only want to show third commit but keep all code 

# Interactive Rebase to Remove Old Code
