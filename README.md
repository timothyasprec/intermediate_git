Git is one of the most fundamental tools for managing collaboration when writing software. Although you surely have worked with Git since early on in your education at Pursuit. Git is a powerful and varied tool. There is always more to learn to manage workflow, increase harmony in collaboration and make sure that we don't lose important code. 

At a simple level, Git is a file that lives inside a software project that stores 'save points' as we go. We can jump to any save point at any time. Save points are generally called 'commits'. We'll start out by looking at a project and perusing the previous commits.

# git log 

Please fork and checkout <repo>
 
One thing to note, is that we can just as well use Git to collaborate on an essay as on a website. This repo is a poem from. Let's take a look at the commits that have been made unitl this point. We can do this by typing `git log` on the command line.
 
 Git log will reveal a scrollable list of all previous commits, including their time, date and author. When you are done looking at the commits, feel free to press `q` to exit the log. 
 
 The log keeps track of all committed changes, noting who and when they were committed. 

# git reflog 

# Resolving a Git Conflict

 Create a new branch
 Make a commit

 Complete merge

# Amend a Commit

Usecase: After working on a new component, I have 13 commits that I have made at many intermediate steps. These steps seems to be more than are necessary to represent sensible milestones for this work. I want to drop some of the commits without changing and of the code. How can I do this? 



# Squash Unnecessary Commits 

checkout a new branch
Make three commits, adding something to the same feature each time 
only want to show third commit but keep all code 

# Interactive Rebase to Remove Old Code
